# codex_tests

This repository contains example scripts for testing Codex.

## Included Scripts

- `export_classes_csv.py` - Exports all Vectorworks class settings to a CSV file named `class_settings.csv`.
## Tests

The `tests` directory contains a pytest suite. The file
`tests/test_export_classes_csv.py` checks that `export_classes_csv.py` creates the expected CSV and demonstrates how the Vectorworks API can be stubbed for testing.
